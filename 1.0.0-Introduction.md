### Introduction
Currently, this is the home of the GA4GH Tool Registry API proposal. The registry API is intended on being a minimal common API for describing tools that we propose for implementation by registries like [Dockstore](https://www.dockstore.org/) and [Agora](https://github.com/broadinstitute/agora). The API is intended to be used for tasks like exchanging, indexing, and searching workflows from the bioinformatics community and beyond. 

We are working on this proposal because we believe with the growing number of repositories for registering and sharing bioinformatics tools, it would be useful to settle on a way for different repositories to communicate with one another. It should probably be emphasized that while some of the examples below are from the [Dockstore](https://dockstore.org/), we recognize that there are many valid different approaches and design decisions that can go into a registry project such as:

* where are the containers hosted (a private registry, a public registry, built on demand?)
* how are descriptors for those containers stored (source control, database)
* what is the format for descriptors?
* how is a registry secured (or not!) 

Our intent is to allow registries built with different assumptions to communicate with one another and be discoverable by third party indexing or aggregation services. 

#### Use Cases

##### Users

Users will be able to access a larger universe of tools while still having the ability to go to the authoritative source for a tool for full information or to contact the author of a tool.

##### Tool Developers

Tool developers will be able register their tools and automatically have them visible on a number of different sites that exchange metadata via this API, allowing them to reach a larger audience.

##### Registry Developers

Registry developers will be able to develop services to either aggregate, index, or mirror tools found on different registries similar to either the remote repositories mechanism in [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-repositories.html) or the repository mechanism in [Apt](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/CommandLine#Adding_Repositories).
